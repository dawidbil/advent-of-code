# advent-of-code

My solutions to AoC. I'm solving them in rust in order to learn this language. No AI was used to write the code; I wanted to read documentation and write the code on my own.

The puzzle ordering in source code is a bit weird: since each day contains two puzzles, I have 24 modules `puzzleXX`, two per day.
